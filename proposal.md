# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Rainbow nonomino

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Our project will create a unique form of sodukoh7 that the user will be able to play. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The features that will be executed will be possibly a turtle drawing the nonomino with colorful blocks and also creating a way for the gamer to play sudoko. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

-

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Jalen Friday - Jalen.Friday@temple.edu - Zhengkang Fan
Raseed Parham - Raseed.parham@temple.edu - Xinwen Zhang

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- The turtles can draw all go the blocks 
- The blocks are semi colorful 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- The user can put some blocks with numbers 
- The blocks are fully colorful

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- I hope to accomplish the unique model we hope to build
- the colorful blocks with intricate details 
- the user is successful in playing the game

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps include working with my team to start with the turtles building the foundations of the blocks. The skills I would need to acquire would be to build the game with the number generator possibly. I am sure Raseed will work on the foundation of the blocks, Jalen and I will work on the foundations of the game. This will include generating the different sets of numbers.
